      "AI Student Advisor is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based conversational AI agent. Essentially, it a chat application with two primary components: retrieval and generation. The retrieval component is responsible for finding the most relevant information from a large corpus of documents, which we call the context. The generation component is then responsible for interacting with an external LLM (Large Language Model) to generate a response by providing it with the user query and the retrieved context. The generated response is then returned to the user.",
